## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwindcss
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### Continued development

I started frontend mentor in order to get projects that would help me build out and understand how react components work especially around the hooks. I was finally able to gain __some__ understanding on how `useEffect` hook works but I still have a long way to go so I would continue to focus on that.
